# 1. Imports
The script begins by importing necessary libraries:
- Standard libraries: `os` (for file operations), `time` (for timing), `logging` (for logging events).
- Typing: Used for type hints to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- Third-party libraries:
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `torch`, `torch.nn`, `torchmetrics`, `timm`, and `torchvision` for deep learning model creation, training, and evaluation.
  - `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image loading and processing.

# 2. Configuration
A Pydantic `Config` class is defined to encapsulate all hyperparameters and settings:
- Model architecture (e.g., backbone name, number of classes).
- Training parameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs, optimizer settings).
- Data paths and device selection (CPU/GPU).
- This approach centralizes configuration, making experiments reproducible and easy to modify.
- An instance of `Config` is created and referenced throughout the script.

# 3. Output Directory and Logging
- The script ensures the output directory exists, creating it if necessary.
- Logging is configured to display info-level messages with timestamps, which helps in tracking the training process and debugging.
- The loaded configuration is logged for reference.

# 4. Model Definition
Defines a custom PyTorch model class `MedicalImageModel`:
- Initializes a backbone model using `timm.create_model` (e.g., Swin Transformer or other architectures).
- Removes the default classifier head to allow for a custom classification head tailored to the dataset.
- The custom classifier consists of:
  - Layer normalization for stabilizing activations.
  - Linear layer to reduce or expand feature dimensions.
  - GELU activation for non-linearity.
  - Dropout for regularization.
  - Final linear layer to output logits for each class.
- Custom weight initialization is applied to the classifier layers for better convergence.
- The `forward` method processes a batch dictionary, extracts image features, and outputs logits for multilabel classification.

# 5. Dataset Definition
Defines a PyTorch `Dataset` class `MedicalDataset`:
- Accepts a DataFrame, configuration, image transforms, and data directory.
- Loads images from disk using PIL, applies the specified transforms (e.g., resizing, normalization).
- Handles label preprocessing:
  - Ensures labels are numeric.
  - Replaces missing values (NaN) and abnormal values (e.g., -1.0) with 0.0 to avoid training issues.
- Returns a dictionary containing the image tensor and the corresponding label tensor for each sample.

# 6. Evaluation Function
Defines an `evaluate` function to assess model performance:
- Sets the model to evaluation mode (disables dropout, etc.).
- Iterates over the validation/test dataloader without gradient computation.
- For each batch:
  - Computes the loss.
  - Applies sigmoid activation to logits to obtain probabilities for multilabel classification.
  - Calculates metrics using `torchmetrics`:
    - Precision, recall, F1 score (macro-averaged).
    - Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each class.
  - Handles exceptions during AUC calculation (e.g., if a class has only one label).
- Aggregates and returns average loss and metrics across all batches.

# 7. Training Loop
Defines a `train_one_epoch` function:
- Sets the model to training mode.
- Iterates over training batches:
  - Computes the loss.
  - Performs backpropagation and optimizer step.
  - Optionally updates the learning rate scheduler.
  - Logs progress every 20 batches or at the end of the epoch.
- Returns the average loss for the epoch.

# 8. Main Function
Defines the `main` function, orchestrating the entire pipeline:
- Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
- Preprocesses label columns to ensure they are numeric and replaces NaN/-1.0 with 0.0.
- Splits the data into training, validation, and test sets based on a 'split' column.
- Defines image transforms for data augmentation (training) and normalization (validation/testing).
- Creates PyTorch datasets and dataloaders for each split.
- Initializes the model, loss function (e.g., BCEWithLogitsLoss for multilabel), optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
- Trains the model for a specified number of epochs:
  - After each epoch, evaluates on the validation set.
  - Saves the model if validation precision improves.
- After training, performs threshold optimization on the validation set to maximize precision (finds the best probability cutoff for each class).
- Evaluates the best model and threshold on the test set, logging all results for analysis and reproducibility.

# 9. Script Entry Point
At the end of the script, includes a standard Python entry point check:
- If the script is run directly (not imported), calls `main()` to start the training and evaluation process.

# Summary
This script provides a complete, modular pipeline for multilabel classification of medical images:
- Data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
- Flexible model definition with configurable hyperparameters.
- Robust training and evaluation with detailed metrics.
- Threshold optimization for improved decision-making.
- Model checkpointing and comprehensive logging for experiment tracking.
