# This computer program learns to look at pictures of chests (like from a doctor's camera).
# It tries to find important things in the pictures.

# --- Getting Ready ---
# These lines are like gathering all the toys and tools the computer needs to play the learning game.
# It needs tools to:
# - Find the picture files (like finding a specific coloring book).
# - Make random choices (like picking a surprise toy).
# - Understand instructions (like listening to rules).
# - Count and do simple math (like counting your fingers).
# - Keep lists of things (like a list of your favorite animals).
# - Have a brain to learn (the 'torch' tool).
# - Have eyes to see the pictures (the 'timm' tool).
# - Get the pictures ready (like cutting out shapes for crafts).
# - Change the pictures a little (like turning a drawing upside down) to learn better.
# - Open the picture files (like opening a book).
# - Write notes about what it's doing (like keeping a diary).
# - Use a stopwatch to see how long things take.
# - Use special fast parts to learn quicker (like using roller skates instead of walking).
# - Work with friends (other computers) to learn together.

# --- Settings ---
# This is like the recipe for the learning game.
# It tells the computer:
# - Which special eyes to use to look at the pictures.
# - How many different things it needs to look for (like finding 14 different shapes).
# - How big the pictures should be.
# - How fast to learn (not too fast, not too slow!).
# - How many times to look at all the pictures (like reading a book 15 times).
# - Where the pictures are stored.
# - Where to save what it learns.
# - A secret number to make sure it does the same thing every time we run it.

# --- Making Notes ---
# This part sets up the computer's diary so it can write down what it's doing.

# --- Working Together ---
# This part helps computers talk to each other if we use more than one to learn faster.

# --- Making Random Things the Same ---
# This makes sure that even if the computer picks random things, it picks the same random things every time, like always picking the red crayon first.

# --- Measuring Mistakes ---
# This is a special way for the computer to know when it makes a mistake, especially for tricky pictures.

# --- The Computer's Eyes and Brain ---
# This builds the main part that learns.
# It can use one set of eyes or many sets of eyes working together.
# It has:
# - Eyes: To look at the picture and find patterns.
# - Brain: To make a guess based on what the eyes see.
# It can also pause learning for the eyes while the brain learns more.

# --- Getting Pictures Ready ---
# This part gets the pictures ready for the computer to look at.
# It opens the picture file, makes it the right size, and maybe flips it or changes colors a little.
# It turns the picture into numbers the computer brain can understand.
# If a picture is missing or broken, it just uses an empty space.
# There's a regular way and a super-fast way (DALI) to do this.

# --- Checking the Learning ---
# This is like a quiz for the computer.
# It looks at pictures it hasn't learned from and makes guesses.
# We check how many guesses are right and wrong.
# We use score keepers (like counting points) to see how well it did overall.
# It tells us the computer's score (like getting stars on a test).

# --- Teaching the Computer ---
# This is where the computer learns!
# It looks at a few pictures at a time.
# It makes a guess.
# It checks if the guess was right or wrong using the 'mistake measurer'.
# If it was wrong, it changes its brain a little bit to do better next time.
# It does this over and over again for all the training pictures.
# It uses the 'scaler' tool to help it learn faster without messing up.
# It slowly changes how fast it learns using the 'scheduler'.

# --- Saving the Brain ---
# After learning, we save the computer's brain so we can use it later without teaching it all over again.
# We save it in special formats (like saving a drawing).

# --- The Learning Adjuster ---
# This tool helps the computer change its brain when it learns.
# It decides how much to change the brain based on the mistakes it made.
# We can tell it to change different parts of the brain at different speeds.

# --- Putting Pictures Together ---
# This helper makes sure that if some pictures couldn't be loaded, the computer doesn't get confused.

# --- The Main Plan ---
# This is the main part that runs everything in order:
# 1. Get ready: Set up notes, connect computers if needed, set the secret number.
# 2. Load the list: Read the file that lists all the pictures and what's in them.
# 3. Clean up: Make sure the list is easy to read and the labels are simple (like 0 for 'no' and 1 for 'yes').
# 4. Split the pictures: Divide pictures into groups for learning, checking, and a final test.
# 5. Prepare the pictures: Create the tools (loaders) that get batches of pictures ready.
# 6. Build the brain: Create the computer's eyes and brain model.
# 7. Get the adjuster: Create the tool that helps the brain learn (optimizer).
# 8. Get the mistake measurer: Choose how the computer knows it made a mistake.
# 9. Get the learning speed controller: Set up how the learning speed changes over time.
# 10. Start Learning Loop:
    # - Repeat for the chosen number of times (epochs):
        # - Teach the computer using the training pictures.
        # - Check how well it learned using the checking pictures.
        # - If it did better than before, save its brain!
# 11. After Learning:
    # - Load the best brain that was saved.
    # - Find the best way to make final decisions (optimize threshold) using the checking pictures.
    # - Do a final test on the test pictures (if any) using the best brain and best decision rule.
    # - Write down the final scores.
    # - Save the final brain in different ways.
# 12. Cleanup: Disconnect computers if needed and say the program is finished.

# --- Starting the Game ---
# This part starts the whole program when you run the file.
# It lets you give instructions from the outside, like telling it to use a different number of learning rounds.
# Then, it runs the main plan.
